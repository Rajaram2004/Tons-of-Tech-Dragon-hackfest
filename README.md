# PROJECT TITLE: FEED FORWARD 
FeedForward is a Web application aimed at reducing food waste by redistributing surplus food to those in need.
It connects three key user groups: food donors (hotels, restaurants, and event organizers), volunteers who pick up and deliver the food and individuals experiencing food insecurity. 
To motivate volunteers, FeedForward includes a gamified leaderboard that rewards points for successful deliveries and photo verifications.
It leverages AI technology to analyze donated food images and predict shelf life, prioritizing perishable items for prompt distribution. 
Any food deemed unsuitable for consumption is redirected for composting or animal feed, minimizing waste.
Its backend securely manages user information, tracks donations, and provides real-time updates on food availability through Google Maps API. 
With robust image verification processes in place, FeedForward ensures quality assurance for every donation.
Ultimately, this initiative fosters community compassion while ensuring timely access to meals for those in need.
